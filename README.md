# Techniconfs README

## What is it?

Techniconfs is the software behind http://techniconfs.com and will be your stop on the web to find the technical conferences you are looking for. Some of the ideas behind Techniconfs are:

* help people find conferences they want to attend close to where they are
* push traffic to the conference sites themselves
* allow people to find out who else is going to be attending
* help the technical community to grow small, local conferences

How we're going to do this? I don't know, but that's the idea.
